<h1>Zhe Zhao</h1>

<p>
   I'm currently a second-year master student in <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/stats">Statistics</a> at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of    Michigan</a>. I'm working as a data analyst for various reaserch projects on outcomes of cirrhosis supervised by <a href="https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/4313/elliot-benjamin-tapper-md">Dr. Elliot Tapper</a>, and as a research assistant on a project applying Bayesian methods to construct astronomical catalogs supervised by <a href="https://regier.stat.lsa.umich.edu/">Dr. Jeffrey Regier</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  My research interests include applying statistical methods on analysis of large-scale electronic health records, Bayesian methods in astronomy and computational algorithms in statistical inference.
